Title: Kasner interiors from analytic hairy black holes
Authors: Daniel Areán, Hyun-Sik Jeong, Juan F. Pedraza, Le-Chen Qu
Summary: We conduct an exhaustive study of the interior geometry of a family of
asymptotically AdS$_{d+1}$ hairy black holes in an analytically controllable
setup. The black holes are exact solutions to an Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton
theory and include the well-known Gubser-Rocha model. After reviewing the
setup, we scrutinize the geometry beyond the horizon, finding that these
backgrounds can exhibit timelike or Kasner singularities. We generalize the no
inner-horizon theorem for hairy black holes to accommodate these findings. We
then consider observables sensitive to the geometry behind the horizon, such as
Complexity = Anything and the thermal $a$-function. In the Kasner case, we
propose a new variant of complexity that characterizes the late-time rate by
the Kasner exponents, extending previous work by J{\o}rstad, Myers and Ruan.
Additionally, we elucidate the power-law behavior of the thermal $a$-function
near the singularity, directly relating it to the Kasner exponents. Finally, we
introduce axion-like fields in the Gubser-Rocha model to study the impact of
translational symmetry breaking on the black hole interior. We show that Kasner
singularities occur for both explicit and spontaneous symmetry breaking, with
the Kasner exponents depending on the strength of broken translations only in
the latter case.

Title: IDEAL characterization of vacuum pp-waves
Authors: Igor Khavkine, David McNutt, Lode Wylleman
Summary: An IDEAL characterization of a particular spacetime metric, $g_0$, consists
of a set of tensorial equations $T[g] = 0$ arising from expressions constructed
from the metric, $g$, its curvature tensor and its covariant derivatives and
which are satisfied if and only if $g$ is locally isometric to the original
metric $g_0$. Earlier applications of the IDEAL classification of spacetimes
relied on the construction of particular scalar polynomial curvature invariants
as an important step in the procedure.
  In this paper we investigate the well-known class of vacuum pp-wave
spacetimes, where all scalar polynomial curvature invariants vanish, and
determine the applicability of an IDEAL classification for these spacetimes. We
consider a modification of the IDEAL approach which permits a corresponding
extension of the Stewart-Walker lemma. With this change, we are able to
construct invariants and IDEAL-ly classify all of the vacuum pp-wave solutions
which admit a two- or higher-dimensional isometry group, with the exception of
one case.

Title: Gravitational wave surrogate model for spinning, intermediate mass ratio binaries based on perturbation theory and numerical relativity
Authors: Katie Rink, Ritesh Bachhar, Tousif Islam, Nur E. M. Rifat, Kevin Gonzalez-Quesada, Scott E. Field, Gaurav Khanna, Scott A. Hughes, Vijay Varma
Summary: We present BHPTNRSur2dq1e3, a reduced order surrogate model of gravitational
waves emitted from binary black hole (BBH) systems in the comparable to large
mass ratio regime with aligned spin ($\chi_1$) on the heavier mass ($m_1$). We
trained this model on waveform data generated from point particle black hole
perturbation theory (ppBHPT) with mass ratios varying from $3 \leq q \leq 1000$
and spins from $-0.8 \leq \chi_1 \leq 0.8$. The waveforms are $13,500 \ m_1$
long and include all spin-weighted spherical harmonic modes up to $\ell = 4$
except the $(4,1)$ and $m = 0$ modes. We find that for binaries with $\chi_1
\lesssim -0.5$, retrograde quasi-normal modes are significantly excited,
thereby complicating the modeling process. To overcome this issue, we introduce
a domain decomposition approach to model the inspiral and merger-ringdown
portion of the signal separately. The resulting model can faithfully reproduce
ppBHPT waveforms with a median time-domain mismatch error of $8 \times
10^{-5}$. We then calibrate our model with numerical relativity (NR) data in
the comparable mass regime $(3 \leq q \leq 10)$. By comparing with spin-aligned
BBH NR simulations at $q = 15$, we find that the dominant quadrupolar
(subdominant) modes agree to better than $\approx 10^{-3} \ (\approx 10^{-2})$
when using a time-domain mismatch error, where the largest source of
calibration error comes from the transition-to-plunge and ringdown
approximations of perturbation theory. Mismatch errors are below $\approx
10^{-2}$ for systems with mass ratios between $6 \leq q \leq 15$ and typically
get smaller at larger mass ratio. Our two models - both the ppBHPT waveform
model and the NR-calibrated ppBHPT model - will be publicly available through
gwsurrogate and the Black Hole Perturbation Toolkit packages.

Title: Searching for String Bosenovas with Gravitational Wave Detectors
Authors: Dawid Brzeminski, Anson Hook, Junwu Huang, Clayton Ristow
Summary: We study the phenomenology of string bosenova explosions in vector
superradiance clouds around spinning black holes, focusing on the observable
consequences in gravitational wave detectors and accelerometers. During the
growth of the superradiance cloud, the dark gauge field might reach a critical
field strength, when a network of dark photon strings is produced via a
superheated phase transition. These dark photon strings will then absorb the
energy in the background fields and get ejected from the cloud, with total
energy as large as the rotational energy of the black hole. In this paper, we
study the subsequent evolution of this dense string network, and the resulting
observational consequences depending on the unknown string tension, or almost
equivalently, the ratio between the quartic and the gauge coupling in the
Abelian Higgs model. Strings with large tension will dissipate into
gravitational waves, detectable over a wide range of frequencies, from $\sim$
nHz near supermassive black holes, to $\gtrsim 10$ MHz around stellar mass
black holes. This is the first known source of high frequency gravitational
waves, unconstrained by cosmological observations. The strain of this
gravitational wave can be larger than $10^{-14}$ at low frequencies, lasting
for longer than typical duration of experiments. Small tension strings, with
total lengths in the network as large as $10^{40}$ km, can travel to the earth
with appreciable rate from any black hole in the Milky Way and interact with
earth based accelerometers. If the Standard Model particles are directly
charged under the dark photon, e.g. B-L, this interaction leads to an
acceleration of Standard Model particles that is independent of the coupling
constant. We work out the spectral density of this acceleration, and project
that modern accelerometers and equivalence principle tests can be sensitive to
the passing of these strings.

Title: Gravitational radiation reaction for compact binary systems at the fourth-and-a-half post-Newtonian order
Authors: Luc Blanchet, Guillaume Faye, David Trestini
Summary: We compute the gravitational radiation-reaction force on a compact binary
source at the fourth-and-a-half post-Newtonian (4.5PN) order of general
relativity, i.e., 2PN order beyond the leading 2.5PN radiation reaction. The
calculation is valid for general orbits in a general frame, but in a particular
coordinate system which is an extension of the Burke-Thorne coordinate system
at the lowest order. With the radiation-reaction acceleration, we derive (from
first principles) the flux-balance laws associated with the energy, the angular
and linear momenta, and the center-of-mass position, in a general frame and up
to 4.5PN order. Restricting our attention to the frame of the center of mass,
we point out that the equations of motion acquire a non-local-in-time
contribution at the 4.5PN order, made of the integrated flux of linear momentum
(responsible for the recoil of the source) together with the instantaneous flux
of center-of-mass position. The non-local contribution was overlooked in the
past literature, which assumed locality of the radiation-reaction force in the
center of mass frame at 4.5PN order. We discuss the consequences of this
non-local effect and obtain consistent non-local equations of motion and flux
balance laws at 4.5PN order in the center-of-mass frame.

Title: Conformal quantum mechanics of causal diamonds: Quantum instability and semiclassical approximation
Authors: H. E. Camblong, A. Chakraborty, P. Lopez-Duque, C. Ordóñez
Summary: Causal diamonds are known to have thermal behavior that can be probed by
finite-lifetime observers equipped with energy-scaled detectors. This
thermality can be attributed to the time evolution of observers within the
causal diamond, governed by one of the conformal quantum mechanics (CQM)
symmetry generators: the noncompact hyperbolic operator $S$. In this paper, we
show that the unbounded nature of $S$ endows it with a quantum instability,
which is a generalization of a similar property exhibited by the inverted
harmonic oscillator potential. Our analysis is semiclassical, including a
detailed phase-space study of the classical dynamics of $S$ and its dual
operator $R$, and a general semiclassical framework yielding basic instability
and thermality properties that play a crucial role in the quantum behavior of
the theory. For an observer with a finite lifetime $\mathcal{T}$, the detected
temperature
  $T_D = 2 \hbar/(\pi \mathcal{T})$ is associated with a Lyapunov exponent
$\lambda_L = \pi T_D/\hbar$, which is half the upper saturation bound of the
information scrambling rate.

Title: Large $D$ gravity and low $D$ string via $α^{\prime}$ corrections
Authors: Shuxuan Ying
Summary: In this paper, we generalize the correspondence between large $D$ gravity and
low $D$ string theory to the most general case, including its T-dual solutions.
It is well-known that the large $D$ limit of the Schwarzschild-Tangherlini
black hole in gravity becomes a two-dimensional near-horizon geometry.
Similarly, the large $D$ limit of its T-dual solution, obtained by the Buscher
rules, namely the string black hole with a naked singularity, reduces to a
two-dimensional near-singularity geometry. Both of these geometries are
described by the two-dimensional low-energy effective action of string theory
and are related to each other by scale-factor duality. Secondly, we demonstrate
that these near-horizon/singuglarity geometries, including complete
$\alpha^{\prime}$ corrections, can be described by the two-dimensional
Hohm-Zwiebach action. This approach allows for the derivation of
non-perturbative and non-singular solutions. Furthermore, the Hohm-Zwiebach
action provides a systematic way to investigate the $\alpha^{\prime}$-corrected
near-horizon/singularity geometries of different kinds of black holes, which
are difficult to achieve through the Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) model method.
