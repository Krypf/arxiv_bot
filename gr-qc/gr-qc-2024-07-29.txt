Title: Spontaneous symmetry breaking as a result of extra dimensions compactification
Authors: Dmitry Chirkov, Alex Giacomini, Alexey Toporensky, Petr Tretyakov
Summary: We consider dynamics of a scalar field in compactification scenario of
Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet cosmology. It is shown that if the field is non-minimally
coupled to curvature, its asymptotic value under certain conditions may be
shifted from the minimum of its potential. This means that due to influence of
extra dimensions a scalar field with $\lambda \phi^4$ potential can stabilise
away from $\phi=0$ stable point which means an effective symmetry breaking
occurs in such a system.

Title: Exceeding the conformal limit inside rotating neutron stars: Implications to modified theories of gravity
Authors: Raissa F. P. Mendes, Caroline F. Sodré, Felipe T. Falciano
Summary: At the supranuclear densities achieved inside a neutron star, matter may
exhibit extreme properties. In particular, it may be the case that a suitable
average of the speed of sound squared exceeds the so-called conformal limit,
i.e., $\langle c_s^2 \rangle > 1/3$, a condition that is equivalent to the
positiveness of the trace of the energy-momentum tensor at the stellar center.
This property, that holds for highly compact neutron stars obeying many (but
not any) realistic equations of state, would turn these objects into
interesting laboratories for tests of several scalar extensions of general
relativity. In this paper, we investigate how rapid rotation influences the
superconformality of the averaged speed of sound squared and modified gravity
effects that depend thereupon, paying particular attention to scalar-tensor
theories prone to the spontaneous scalarization effect.

Title: Horndeski speed tests with scalar-photon couplings
Authors: Eugeny Babichev, Christos Charmousis, Benjamin Muntz, Antonio Padilla, Ippocratis D. Saltas
Summary: We revisit multi-messenger constraints from neutron star mergers on the speed
of propagation of gravitational and electromagnetic waves in Horndeski and
beyond Horndeski theories. By considering non-trivial couplings between the
dark energy field and the electromagnetic sector, the electromagnetic wave can
propagate through the cosmological background at non-unit speed, altering the
phenomenological constraints on its gravitational counterpart. In particular,
we show that recent models derived from a Kaluza-Klein compactification of
higher dimensional Horndeski models fall into a broader class of theories
disformally related to those whose gravitational waves propagate with unit
speed. This disformal equivalence can, however, be broken by the gravitational
couplings to other sectors with interesting phenomenological consequences. We
also consider higher order couplings between the scalar and the photon with
second order field equations, and show that they are not compatible with
constraints coming from multi-messenger speed tests and the decay of the
gravitational wave.

Title: Delayed jet launching in binary neutron star mergers with realistic initial magnetic fields
Authors: Ricard Aguilera-Miret, Carlos Palenzuela, Federico Carrasco, Stephan Rosswog, Daniele Viganò
Summary: We analyze a long-lived hyper-massive neutron star merger remnant
(post-merger lifetime $>250$ ms) that has been obtained via large eddy
simulations with a gradient subgrid-scale model. We find a clear helicoidal
magnetic field structure that is governed by the toroidal component of the
magnetic field. Although no jet emerges during the simulation time, we observe
at late times a significant increase of the poloidal component of the magnetic
field at all scales. We also compare with the results of several binary neutron
star simulations with moderate resolution of $120$~m, that are evolved up to
$50$~ms after the merger, which differ in terms of the initial topology and
strength of the magnetic field. We find that the best choice is an isotropic
small-scale magnetic field distribution that mimics the turbulent state that
generically develops during the merger. This initial configuration reaches a
closer agreement with our high-resolution simulation results than the purely
dipolar large-scale fields that are commonly employed in these type of
simulations. This provides a recipe to perform such simulations avoiding the
computationally expensive grids required to faithfully capture the
amplification of the magnetic field by Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities.

Title: Entropy and Spectrum of Near-Extremal Black Holes: semiclassical brane solutions to non-perturbative problems
Authors: Sergio Hernández-Cuenca
Summary: The black hole entropy has been observed to generically turn negative at
exponentially low temperatures $T\sim e^{-S_0}$ in the extremal
Bekenstein-Hawking entropy $S_0$, a seeming pathology often attributed to
missing non-perturbative effects. In fact, we show that this negativity must
happen for any effective theory of quantum gravity with an ensemble
description. To do so, we identify the usual gravitational entropy as an
annealed entropy $S_a$, and prove that this quantity gives $S_0$ at extremality
if and only if the ground-state energy is protected by supersymmetry, and
diverges negatively otherwise. The actual thermodynamically-behaved quantity is
the average or quenched entropy $S_q$, whose calculation is poorly understood
in gravity: it involves replica wormholes in a regime where the topological
expansion breaks down. Using matrix integrals we find new instanton saddles
that dominate gravitational correlators at $T\sim e^{-S_0}$ and are dual to
semiclassical wormholes involving dynamical branes. These brane solutions give
the leading contribution to any black hole very near extremality, and a duality
with matrix ensembles would not make sense without them. In the non-BPS case,
they are required to make $S_q$ non-negative and also enhance the negativity of
$S_a$, both effects consistent with matrix integrals evaluated exactly. Our
instanton results are tested against the on-shell action of D3-branes dual to
multiply wrapped Wilson loops in $\mathcal{N}=4$ super-YM, and a precise match
is found. Our analysis of low-energy random matrix spectra also explains the
origin of spectral gaps in supersymmetric theories, not only when there are BPS
states at zero energy, but also for purely non-BPS supermultiplets. In the
former, our prediction for the gap in terms of the degeneracy of BPS states
agrees with the R-charge scaling in gapped multiplets of $\mathcal{N}=2$
super-JT gravity.

Title: $I$-Love-$Q$, and $δM$ too: The role of the mass in universal relations of compact stars
Authors: Eneko Aranguren, José A. Font, Nicolas Sanchis-Gual, Raül Vera
Summary: In the study of rotating neutron stars the $I$-Love-$Q$ relations refer to
the existence of various approximate, equation of state-independent relations
involving the moment of inertia, the Love number and the quadrupole moment.
These relations are relevant for observational astrophysics, since they allow
(in theory) the inference of any two quantities within the $I$-Love-$Q$ triad
out of the third one alone. However, the quantities involved in the relations
are, in fact, normalized by a parameter $M_0$ that arises in the usual
perturbative analytical approach as the mass of the background configuration.
Since $M_0$ is not the mass of the rotating star $M_S$, it is not an
observational quantity, which may affect the application of the relations to
actual observations. This situation is usually ignored in most studies by
taking $M_0$ to be the mass of the star, an approximation that can, in some
cases, be inconsistent. In this paper we extract the value of $M_0$ using an
$\textit{extended}$ version of the universal relations that involve a fourth
parameter, $\delta M$, proportional to the difference $M_S-M_0$. We analyze to
which degree this extended set of relations yields a more precise inference of
compact star properties and equation of state parameters.

Title: Deciphering the Instability of the Black Hole Ringdown Quasinormal Spectrum
Authors: A. Ianniccari, A. J. Iovino, A. Kehagias, P. Pani, G. Perna, D. Perrone, A. Riotto
Summary: The spectrum of the quasinormal modes of the gravitational waves emitted
during the ringdown phase following the merger of two black holes is of primary
importance in gravitational astronomy. However, the spectrum is extremely
sensitive to small disturbances of the system, thus potentially jeopardizing
the predictions of the gravitational wave observables. We offer an analytical
and intuitive explanation of such an instability and its properties based on
the transfer matrix approach of quantum mechanics. We also give a simple
interpretation of the fact that the prompt ringdown response in the time domain
and the black hole greybody factor receive parametrically small corrections,
thus being robust observables.

Title: Spectral instability of black holes: relating the frequency domain to the time domain
Authors: Yiqiu Yang, Zhan-Feng Mai, Run-Qiu Yang, Lijing Shao, Emanuele Berti
Summary: Recent work has shown that the quasinormal mode spectrum of black holes is
unstable under small perturbations (of order $\epsilon$) of the radial
potential, while the early time-domain ringdown waveform is only marginally
affected. In this paper we provide further insight into the apparent tension
between the frequency-domain and the time-domain descriptions by analyzing the
scattering properties of the problem. In the frequency domain, we study
analytically the solutions corresponding to the perturbed potential. We show
that there are two qualitatively different classes of instabilities, and that
both Schwarzschild and Kerr black holes are affected by what we call a "Type
II" instability, i.e., an exponential migration of the mode frequencies away
from their unperturbed value as the perturbing "bump" moves away from the peak
of the unperturbed potential. In the time domain, we elucidate the effect of
the spectral instability in terms of the causal structure of the Green's
function. By using an equivalent scattering problem we confirm analytically
(and show numerically) that the deviation from the unperturbed waveform in the
early ringdown stage is proportional to $\epsilon$ when
$\epsilon\lesssim10^{-2}$.

Title: The interaction between gravitational waves and a viscous fluid shell on a Schwarzschild background
Authors: Nigel T. Bishop
Summary: Previous work has shown that the interaction between gravitational waves
(GWs) and a shell of viscous matter leads to damping of the GWs and heating of
the matter, and that these effects may be astrophysically significant. This
result was derived using the theory of linear perturbations about a Minkowki
background, and in this work the model is extended to be more physically
realistic by allowing the background geometry to be Schwarzschild. It is found
that the difference between using a Schwarzschild or Minkowski background is
minimal when either $r\gg M$ or $\lambda< M$, where $r$ is the radius of the
shell, $\lambda$ is the GW wavelength and $M$ is the mass of the system in
geometric units (so that $1M_\odot=1.48$km). However, when $r\sim 6M$ and
$\lambda\sim 25M$, then the damping and heating effects are about 9 times
larger on a Schwarzschild background than on Minkowski, and such situations
occur astrophysically.

Title: Stability and topological nature of charged Gauss-Bonnet AdS black holes in five dimensions
Authors: Imtak Jeon, Bum-Hoon Lee, Wonwoo Lee, Madhu Mishra
Summary: We examine the thermodynamic characteristics and phase structures of a black
hole, where the black hole horizon could be a hypersurface with positive, zero,
or negative constant curvature, within the framework of Einstein-Maxwell
theory, incorporating a negative cosmological constant and a Gauss-Bonnet
correction. Our research follows the topological approach to black hole
thermodynamics where we treat anti-de Sitter (AdS) black holes as topological
defects in thermodynamic space. We study the nature of the black hole's
critical points and local stability by computing the winding
numbers/topological charge associated with the zero point of the vector field,
derived from the temperature of extremal points and generalized off-shell Gibbs
free energy, respectively. Black holes are classified into different
topological classes based on their topological number. In this study, we found
unlike the charged AdS black hole, the charged GB AdS black hole exhibits a
critical point. Our findings reveal the occurrence of a liquid/gas-like
first-order phase transition between small-large black hole phases of the
spherical charged GB AdS black hole. We conclude that the charged GB AdS and
charged AdS black holes belong to different topological classes in the grand
canonical ensemble. Furthermore, connecting with the previous studies, we
conclude that the charged AdS and charged GB AdS black holes in canonical and
charged GB in the grand canonical ensemble belong to the same topological
classes.

Title: Reconstructing source motion from gravitational wave strain
Authors: Joseph Bayley, Chris Messenger, Graham Woan
Summary: Searches for un-modelled burst gravitational wave signals return potential
candidates for short duration signals. As there is no clear model for the
source in these searches, one needs to understand and reconstruct the system
that produced the gravitational waves. Here we aim to reconstruct the source
motion and masses of a system based only on its gravitational wave strain. We
train a normalising flow on two models including circular orbits and random
unphysical motion of two point masses. These models are used as a toy problem
to illustrate the technique. We then reconstruct a distribution of possible
motions of masses that can produce the given gravitational wave signal. We
demonstrate the ability to reconstruct the full distribution of possible mass
motions from strain data across multiple gravitational wave detectors. This
distribution encompasses the degenerate motions that are expected to produce
identical gravitational wave strains.

Title: (In)stability of de Sitter Quasinormal Mode spectra
Authors: Claude Warnick
Summary: We consider how the quasinormal spectrum for the conformal wave operator on
the static patch of de Sitter changes in response to the addition of a small
potential. Since the quasinormal modes and co-modes are explicitly known, we
are able to give explicit formulae for the instantaneous rate of change of each
frequency in terms of the perturbing potential. We verify these exact
computations numerically using a novel technique extending the spectral
hyperboloidal approach of Jaramillo et al. (2021). We propose a definition for
a family of pseudospectra that we show capture the instability properties of
the quasinormal frequencies.

Title: Astrophysical insights into magnetic Penrose process around parameterized Konoplya-Rezzolla-Zhidenko black hole
Authors: Tursunali Xamidov, Sanjar Shaymatov, Pankaj Sheoran, Bobomurat Ahmedov
Summary: In this study, we investigate the parameterized Konoplya-Rezzolla-Zhidenko
(KRZ) black hole (BH) spacetime in the presence of an external asymptotically
uniform magnetic field. We first examine the innermost stable circular orbit
(ISCO) radii for both neutral and charged test particles, demonstrating that
the deformation parameters, $\delta_1$ and $\delta_2$, reduce the ISCO values.
Subsequently, we assess the energy efficiency of the magnetic Penrose process
(MPP) for an axially symmetric parameterized BH, analyzing the effects of the
deformation parameters and the magnetic field on the energy extraction process.
Our findings indicate that the rotational deformation parameter $\delta_2$ is
crucial for the efficiency of energy extraction from the BH. The synergy
between the rotational deformation parameter and the magnetic field
significantly boosts the energy extraction efficiency, with values exceeding
$100\%$. Interestingly, for extremal BHs with negative $\delta_2$ values, the
energy efficiency increases, in contrast to Kerr BHs where the MPP effect
diminishes. Additionally, we explore the astrophysical implications of the MPP
by deriving the maximum energy of a proton escaping from the KRZ parameterized
BH due to the beta decay of a free neutron near the horizon. Our results show
that negative $\delta_2$ values require stronger magnetic fields to achieve
equivalent energy levels for high-energy protons, providing deeper insights
into high-energy astrophysical phenomena around the parameterized BH.

Title: Proving the absence of large one-loop corrections to the power spectrum of curvature perturbations in transient ultra-slow-roll inflation within the path-integral approach
Authors: Ryodai Kawaguchi, Shinji Tsujikawa, Yusuke Yamada
Summary: We revisit one-loop corrections to the power spectrum of curvature
perturbations $\zeta$ in an inflationary scenario containing a transient
ultra-slow-roll (USR) period. In Ref.[1], it was argued that one-loop
corrections to the power spectrum of $\zeta$ can be larger than the tree-level
one within the parameter region generating the seeds of primordial black holes
during the USR epoch, which implies the breakdown of perturbation theory. We
prove that this is not the case by using a master formula for one-loop
corrections to the power spectrum obtained in Ref.[2]. We derive the same
formula within the path-integral formalism, which is simpler than the original
derivation in [2]. To show the smallness of one-loop corrections, the
consistency relations and the effective constancy of tree-level mode functions
of $\zeta$ for super-Hubble modes play essential roles, with which the master
formula gives a simple expression for one-loop corrections. For concreteness,
we provide a reduced set of interactions including the leading-order one, while
establishing the consistency relations in a self-consistent manner. We also
show how the consistency relations of various operators hold explicitly, which
plays a key role in proving the absence of large one-loop corrections.

Title: Magnetic Penrose Process and Kerr Black Hole Mimickers
Authors: Divyesh P. Viththani, Tapobroto Bhanja, Vishva Patel, Pankaj S. Joshi
Summary: The present study investigates the negative energy orbits and energy
extraction efficiency using the magnetic Penrose process in various regular
black hole geometries surrounded by electromagnetic fields. Utilizing numerical
simulations, we analyze the efficiency of this process in Kerr and
Simpson-Visser geometries, focusing on extremal black holes. Interestingly, our
study demonstrates that the energy extraction efficiency remains
indistinguishable between Kerr and Simpson-Visser geometries, regardless of the
regularization parameter ($l$); this trend is consistent with previous studies
of the Penrose process and superradiance. Additionally, we present results for
the rotating Hayward black hole, showing that efficiency is influenced by spin
and deviation parameters ($g$), as well as the induced magnetic field and
charge of the compact object. Notably, we observe that energy extraction
efficiency is highest in the rotating Hayward black hole compared to Kerr and
Simpson-Visser geometries, particularly in scenarios where the magnetic field
and charge are minimal. Our study highlights the significant role of spin,
charge and magnetic field characteristics in maximizing energy extraction
efficiency, particularly in the rotating Hayward black hole context.

Title: Thermodynamics and phase transition of Bardeen-AdS-class black holes
Authors: Shan-Ping Wu, Shao-Wen Wei
Summary: In a generalized parameter space, regular black holes can be regarded as
non-singular solutions under specific parameters in Einstein gravity theory
coupled with non-linear electromagnetic fields. Following this concept, we
investigate the thermodynamic states and phase transitions of Bardeen-AdS-class
black holes, revealing that the system can be classified into two categories,
Type I and Type II, based on whether it adopts a pure Bardeen-AdS spacetime
without event horizons or a Bardeen-AdS black hole as its phase state, each
exhibiting distinct thermodynamic properties. If one includes the Bardeen-AdS
black holes in the system (Type I), there will be three distinct black hole
states and the phase transitions between them are analogous to the
Reissner-Nordstrom-AdS black holes. On the other hand, if the pure Bardeen-AdS
spacetime is included (Type II), an additional tiny black hole state emerges. A
phase transition reminiscent of the Hawking-Page transition was found.
Significantly, in this scenario, thermodynamical characteristic curves exhibit
discontinuous behavior, which attributes to the multiple horizons. The presence
of a Bardeen-AdS black hole within the phase structure of the Bardeen-AdS-class
black hole profoundly modifies the thermodynamical properties of the system,
highlighting the novel aspects of regular black holes.

Title: Quasi-Normal Modes of Loop Quantum Black Holes Formed from Gravitational Collapse
Authors: Chao Zhang, Anzhong Wang
Summary: In this paper, we study the quasi-normal modes (QNMs) of a scalar field in
the background of a large class of quantum black holes that can be formed from
gravitational collapse of a dust fluid in the framework of effective loop
quantum gravity. The loop quantum black holes (LQBHs) are characterized by
three free parameters, one of which is the mass parameter, while the other two
are purely due to quantum geometric effects. Among these two quantum
parameters, one is completely fixed by black hole thermodynamics and its
effects are negligible for macroscopic black holes, while the second parameter
is completely free (in principle). In the studies of the QNMs of such LQBHs, we
pay particular attention to the difference of the QNMs between LQBHs and
classical ones, so that they can be observed for the current and forthcoming
gravitational wave observations, whereby place the LQBH theory directly under
the test of observations.

Title: Some Lower Dimensional Quantum Field Theories Reduced from Chern-Simons Gauge Theories
Authors: Burak Oğuz, Bayram Tekin
Summary: We study symmetry reductions in the context of Euclidean Chern-Simons gauge
theories to obtain lower dimensional field theories. Symmetry reduction in
certain gauge theories is a common tool for obtaining explicit soliton
solutions. Although pure Chern-Simons theories do not admit solitonic
solutions, symmetry reduction still leads to interesting results. We establish
relations at the semiclassical regime between pure Chern-Simons theories on
$S^3$ and the reduced Quantum Field Theories, based on actions obtained by the
symmetry reduction of the Chern-Simons action, spherical symmetry being the
prominent one. We also discuss symmetry reductions of Chern-Simons theories on
the disk, yielding $BF$-theory in two dimensions, which signals a curious
relationship between symmetry reductions and the boundary conformal field
theories. Finally, we study the Chern-Simons-Higgs instantons and show that
under certain circumstances, the reduced action can formally be viewed as the
action of a supersymmetric quantum mechanical model. We discuss the extent to
which the reduced actions have a fermionic nature at the level of the partition
function.
