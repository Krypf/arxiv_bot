Authors: Deep Chatterjee, Ethan Marx, William Benoit, Ravi Kumar, Malina Desai, Ekaterina Govorkova, Alec Gunny, Eric Moreno, Rafia Omer, Ryan Raikman, Muhammed Saleem, Shrey Aggarwal, Michael W. Coughlin, Philip Harris, Erik Katsavounidis
Summary: We report a gravitational-wave parameter estimation algorithm, AMPLFI, based
on likelihood-free inference using normalizing flows. The focus of AMPLFI is to
perform real-time parameter estimation for candidates detected by
machine-learning based compact binary coalescence search, Aframe. We present
details of our algorithm and optimizations done related to data-loading and
pre-processing on accelerated hardware. We train our model using binary
black-hole (BBH) simulations on real LIGO-Virgo detector noise. Our model has
$\sim 6$ million trainable parameters with training times $\lesssim 24$ hours.
Based on online deployment on a mock data stream of LIGO-Virgo data, Aframe +
AMPLFI is able to pick up BBH candidates and infer parameters for real-time
alerts from data acquisition with a net latency of $\sim 6$s.

Title: Generative Flow Networks in Covariant Loop Quantum Gravity
Authors: Joseph Bunao, Pietropaolo Frisoni, Athanasios Kogios, Jared Wogan
Summary: Spin foams arose as the covariant (path integral) formulation of quantum
gravity depicting transition amplitudes between different quantum geometry
states. As such, they provide a scheme to study the no boundary proposal,
specifically the nothing to something transition and compute relevant
observables using high performance computing (HPC). Following recent advances,
where stochastic algorithms (Markov Chain Monte Carlo-MCMC) were used, we
employ Generative Flow Networks, a newly developed machine learning algorithm
to compute the expectation value of the dihedral angle for a 4-simplex and
compare the results with previous works.

Title: Rates and beaming angles of GRBs associated with compact binary coalescences
Authors: Shasvath J. Kapadia, Dimple, Dhruv Jain, Resmi Lekshmi, Kuntal Misra, K. G. Arun
Summary: Some, if not all, binary neutron star (BNS) coalescences, and a fraction of
neutron - star black hole (NSBH) mergers, are thought to produce sufficient
mass-ejection to power Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs). However, this fraction, as well
as the distribution of beaming angles of BNS-associated GRBs, are poorly
constrained from observation. Recent work applied machine learning tools to
analyze GRB light curves observed by {\textit{Fermi}}/GBM and {\it Swift}/BAT.
GRBs were segregated into multiple distinct clusters, with the tantalizing
possibility that one of them (BNS cluster) could be associated with BNSs and
another (NSBH cluster) with NSBHs. As a proof of principle, assuming that all
GRBs detected by {\it Fermi}/GBM and {\it Swift}/BAT associated with BNSs
(NSBHs) lie in the BNS (NSBH) cluster, we estimate their rates
($\mathrm{Gpc}^{-3}\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$). We compare these rates with
corresponding BNS and NSBH rates estimated by the LIGO-Virgo-Kagra (LVK)
collaboration from the first three observing runs (O1, O2, O3). We find that
the BNS rates are consistent with LVK's rate estimates, assuming a uniform
distribution of beaming fractions ($f_b \in [0.01, 0.1]$). Conversely, using
the LVK's BNS rate estimates, assuming all BNS mergers produce GRBs, we are
able to constrain the beaming angle distribution to $\theta_j \in [0.8^{\circ},
38.8^{\circ}]$ at $90\%$ confidence. We similarly place a lower limit on the
fraction of GRB-Bright NSBHs to $f_B \gtrsim 0.10$ ($f_B \gtrsim 0.022$) with
{\it Fermi}/GBM ({\it Swift}/BAT) data.

Title: Waveform models for the gravitational-wave memory effect: Extreme mass-ratio limit and final memory offset
Authors: Arwa Elhashash, David A. Nichols
Summary: The gravitational-wave (GW) memory effect is a strong-field relativistic
phenomenon that is associated with a persistent change in the GW strain after
the passage of a GW. The nonlinear effect arises from interactions of GWs
themselves in the wave zone and is an observable effect connected to the
infrared properties of general relativity. The detection of the GW memory
effect is possible with LIGO and Virgo in a population of binary-black-hole
(BBH) mergers or from individual events with next-generation ground- and
space-based GW detectors or pulsar timing arrays. Matched-filtering-based
searches for the GW memory require accurate, and preferably rapid-to-evaluate
waveform models of the memory effect's GW signal. One important element of such
a waveform model is a model for the final memory offset -- namely, the net
change in strain between early and late times. In this paper, we construct a
model for the final memory offset from the merger of nonspinning BBH systems in
quasicircular orbits. A novel ingredient of this model is that we first compute
the memory signal for extreme mass-ratio inspirals using a high
post-Newtonian-order analytic calculation, and we use this analytical result to
fix the coefficient in the fit which is linear in the mass-ratio. The resulting
memory-offset fit could be used for detecting the GW memory for binaries that
merge on a timescale that is short relative to the inverse of the low-frequency
cutoff of a GW detector. Additionally, this fit will be useful for analytic
waveform models of the GW memory signals in the time and frequency domains.

Title: Spinning Black Hole Scattering at $\mathcal{O}(G^3 S^2)$: Casimir Terms, Radial Action and Hidden Symmetry
Authors: Dogan Akpinar, Fernando Febres Cordero, Manfred Kraus, Michael S. Ruf, Mao Zeng
Summary: We resolve subtleties in calculating the post-Minksowskian dynamics of binary
systems, as a spin expansion, from massive scattering amplitudes of fixed
finite spin. In particular, the apparently ambiguous spin Casimir terms can be
fully determined from the gradient of the spin-diagonal part of the amplitudes
with respect to $S^2 = -s(s+1)\hbar^2$, using an interpolation between massive
amplitudes with different spin representations. From two-loop amplitudes of
spin-0 and spin-1 particles minimally coupled to gravity, we extract the spin
Casimir terms in the conservative scattering angle between a spinless and a
spinning black hole at $\mathcal{O}(G^3 S^2)$, finding agreement with known
results in the literature. This completes an earlier study [Phys. Rev. Lett.
130 (2023), 021601] that calculated the non-Casimir terms from amplitudes. We
also illustrate our methods using a model of spinning bodies in
electrodynamics, finding agreement between scattering amplitude predictions and
classical predictions in a root-Kerr electromagnetic background up to
$\mathcal{O}(\alpha^3 S^2)$. For both gravity and electrodynamics, the finite
part of the amplitude coincides with the two-body radial action in the aligned
spin limit, generalizing the amplitude-action relation beyond the spinless
case. Surprisingly, the two-loop amplitude displays a hidden spin-shift
symmetry in the probe limit, which was previously observed at one loop. We
conjecture that the symmetry holds to all orders in the coupling constant and
is a consequence of integrability of Kerr orbits in the probe limit at the
first few orders in spin.

Title: A new approach to renormalization group improved gravitational action
Authors: Alfio Bonanno, Konstantinos F. Dialektopoulos, Vasilios Zarikas
Summary: A new gravitational action is presented that could be a fair minimal
description of the effective gravitational action in the context of Asymptotic
Safety. It generates consistent modified Einstein equations where $\Lambda$ and
$G$ are functions of spacetime. In addition, these equations respect, without
any ad hoc choices, the Bianchi identities. We analyse this action in a quantum
cosmology scenario. Furthermore, assuming homogeneous and isotropic spacetime,
the action gives a non singular cosmology with power law inflation. Tensor and
scalar perturbations have been used to constraint the free parameters.

Title: Diagnostic Approaches for Interacting generalized holographic Ricci Dark Energy Models
Authors: Omar Enkhili, Farida Bargach, Dalale Mhamdi, Taoufik Ouali, Ahmed Errahmani
Summary: In this paper, we present an analytical solution for the interacting
generalized holographic dark energy model, assuming a linear interaction rate
between dark energy and dark matter. We determine the equation of state
parameter, the generalized holographic Ricci dark energy density, the matter
density, and the deceleration parameter. By analyzing the behavior of these
cosmological parameters, we demonstrate that our model aligns with recent
observations and reproduces the late-time accelerated expansion of the
Universe. To compare our model with the $\Lambda$CDM model, we use various
diagnostic tools including statefinder, $Om(z)$-diagnostic, statefinder
hierarchy, growth rate analysis, and $\omega_H$-$\omega'_H$ plane. We also
analyze the stability of the model by examining the speed of sound. These
methods show that the dynamics of the Universe remain very close to that of the
standard cosmological model.

Title: A Comment on Deriving the Gibbons-Hawking-York Term From the String Worldsheet
Authors: Amr Ahmadain, Vasudev Shyam, Zihan Yan
Summary: In this note, we show that the noncovariant metric boundary term obtained
from the nonlinear sigma model worldsheet derivation of the bulk off-shell
sphere partition function is closely related to the Einstein boundary term in
the Gamma-Gamma noncovariant action. In fact, when expressed in terms of the
trace of the extrinsic curvature tensor, we illustrate that this boundary term
has one-half the coefficient of the Gibbons-Hawking-York boundary term required
such that the total (bulk plus boundary) off-shell classical action has a
well-posed variational principle with Dirichlet boundary conditions.

Title: Gravitational waves from a curvature-induced phase transition of a Higgs-portal dark matter sector
Authors: Andreas Mantziris, Orfeu Bertolami
Summary: The study of interactions between dark matter and the Higgs field opens an
exciting connection between cosmology and particle physics, since such
scenarios can impact the features of dark matter as well as interfering with
the spontaneous breaking of the electroweak symmetry. Furthermore, such
Higgs-portal models of dark matter should be suitably harmonised with the
various epochs of the universe and the phenomenological constraints imposed by
collider experiments. At the same time, the prospect of a stochastic
gravitational wave background offers a promising new window into the primordial
universe, which can complement the insights gained from accelerators. In this
study, we examined whether gravitational waves can be generated from a
curvature-induced phase transition of a non-minimally coupled dark scalar field
with a portal coupling to the Higgs field. The main requirement is that the
phase transition is of first order, which can be achieved through the
introduction of a cubic term on the scalar potential and the sign change of the
curvature scalar. This mechanism was investigated in the context of a dynamical
spacetime during the transition from inflation to kination, while also
considering the possibility for inducing electroweak symmetry breaking in this
manner for a sufficiently low reheating temperature when the Higgs-portal
coupling is extremely weak. We considered a large range of inflationary scales
and both cases of positive and negative values for the non-minimal coupling,
while taking into account the bound imposed by Big Bang Nucleosythesis. The
resulting gravitational wave amplitudes are boosted by kination and thus
constrain the parameter space of the couplings significantly. Even though the
spectra lie at high frequencies for the standard high inflationary scales,
there are combinations of parameter space where they could be probed with
future experiments.

Title: Generalized Hamilton spaces: new developments and applications
Authors: J. J. Relancio, L. Santamaría-Sanz
Summary: In this work, we make new developments in generic cotangent bundle
geometries, depending on all phase-space variables. In particular, we will
focus on the so-called generalized Hamilton spaces, discussing how the main
ingredients of this geometrical framework, such as the Hamiltonian and the
nonlinear and affine connections, can be derived from a given metric. Several
properties of this kind of spaces are demonstrated for autoparallel
Hamiltonians. Moreover, we study the spacetime and momentum isometries of the
metric. Finally, we discuss the possible applications of cotangent bundle
geometries in quantum gravity, such as the construction of deformed
relativistic kinematics and non-commutative spacetimes.

Title: Comment on "Exact massless spinor quasibound states of Schwarzschild black hole"
Authors: R. R. S. Oliveira
Summary: In this comment, we point out a series of errors made by Senjaya in your
paper (2024) \cite{Senjaya}. In particular, these errors involved the Dirac
equation in the 3+1 dimensional Schwarzschild spacetime, tetrad field, curved
gamma matrices, and the time-independent Dirac equation written in terms of the
inner/scalar product between the gamma matrices and the orbital angular
momentum (i.e., $\vec{\gamma}\cdot\vec{L}$). Besides, the strange/peculiar
thing about all this is that even Senjaya \cite{Senjaya} citing Collas and
Klein \cite{Collas}, where the (mathematical) formalism is correct, everything
indicates that he ``ignored'' or ``forgot'' to use such formalism in your
paper. Therefore, using Ref. \cite{Collas}, we show here the correct form of
the errors made by Senjaya \cite{Senjaya}.

Title: Hawking radiation with pure states
Authors: K. Sravan Kumar, João Marto
Summary: Hawking's seminal work on black hole radiation highlights a critical issue in
our understanding of quantum field theory in curved spacetime (QFTCS),
specifically the problem of unitarity loss (where pure states evolve into mixed
states). In this paper, we examine a recent proposal for a direct-sum QFTCS,
which maintains unitarity through a novel quantization method that employs
superselection rules based on discrete spacetime transformations. This approach
describes a quantum state as components that evolve within superselection
sectors of the complete Hilbert space, adhering to the discrete symmetries of a
Schwarzschild black hole. Consequently, it represents a maximally entangled
pure state as a direct-sum of two components in the interior and exterior
regions of the black hole, thereby preserving the unitarity of Hawking
radiation by keeping it in the form of pure states.

Title: Towards unveiling the large-scale nature of gravity with the wavelet scattering transform
Authors: Georgios Valogiannis, Francisco Villaescusa-Navarro, Marco Baldi
Summary: We present the first application of the Wavelet Scattering Transform (WST) in
order to constrain the nature of gravity using the three-dimensional (3D)
large-scale structure of the universe. Utilizing the Quijote-MG N-body
simulations, we can reliably model the 3D matter overdensity field for the f(R)
Hu-Sawicki modified gravity (MG) model down to $k_{\rm max}=0.5$ h/Mpc.
Combining these simulations with the Quijote $\nu$CDM collection, we then
conduct a Fisher forecast of the marginalized constraints obtained on gravity
using the WST coefficients and the matter power spectrum at redshift z=0. Our
results demonstrate that the WST substantially improves upon the 1$\sigma$
error obtained on the parameter that captures deviations from standard General
Relativity (GR), yielding a tenfold improvement compared to the corresponding
matter power spectrum result. At the same time, the WST also enhances the
precision on the $\Lambda$CDM parameters and the sum of neutrino masses, by
factors of 1.2-3.4 compared to the matter power spectrum, respectively. Despite
the overall reduction in the WST performance when we focus on larger scales, it
still provides a relatively $4.5\times$ tighter 1$\sigma$ error for the MG
parameter at $k_{\rm max}=0.2$ h/Mpc, highlighting its great sensitivity to the
underlying gravity theory. This first proof-of-concept study reaffirms the
constraining properties of the WST technique and paves the way for exciting
future applications in order to perform precise large-scale tests of gravity
with the new generation of cutting-edge cosmological data.

Title: A semi-analytic treatment of quasinormal excitation factors in the eikonal regime
Authors: Chun-Hung Chen, Hing-Tong Cho, Anna Chrysostomou, Alan S. Cornell
Summary: In this paper, we present an enhanced semi-analytic method for calculating
quasinormal excitation factors in the eikonal regime, specifically for
Schwarzschild black holes. To achieve improved accuracy in our quasinormal mode
computations, we extend the Dolan and Ottewill inverse multipolar expansion
technique and incorporate higher-order corrections from the WKB method of Iyer
and Will. Our approach is carried out to a higher order than previous methods,
thereby reducing the relative error, particularly for lower multipolar numbers.
We validate our results by comparing them with those obtained using the Mano,
Suzuki, and Takasugi method, demonstrating excellent agreement. A key advantage
of our method is its ability to extract quasinormal excitation factors, which
are crucial for accurately modeling gravitational wave signals from binary
black hole mergers. This advancement provides a useful tool for future
gravitational wave studies, enabling better quantification of quasinormal mode
excitations and more precise identification of individual modes during black
hole ringdowns.

Title: Can we learn from matter creation to solve the $H_{0}$ tension problem?
Authors: Emilio Elizalde, Martiros Khurshudyan, Sergei D. Odintsov
Summary: The $H_{0}$ tension problem is studied in the light of a matter creation
mechanism (an effective approach to replacing dark energy), the way to define
the matter creation rate being of pure phenomenological nature. Bayesian
(probabilistic) Machine Learning is used to learn the constraints on the free
parameters of the models, with the learning being based on the generated
expansion rate, $H(z)$. Taking advantage of the method, the constraints for
three redshift ranges are learned. Namely, for the two redshift ranges: $z\in
[0,2]$~(cosmic chronometers) and $z\in [0,2.5]$~(cosmic chronometers + BAO),
covering already available $H(z)$ data, to validate the learned results; and
for a third redshift interval, $z\in[0,5]$, for forecasting purposes. It is
learned that the $3\alpha H_{0}$ term in the creation rate provides options
that have the potential to solve the $H_{0}$ tension problem.

Title: On supertranslation invariant Lorentz charges
Authors: Sumanta Chakraborty, Sk Jahanur Hoque, Amitabh Virmani
Summary: In recent papers, Fuentealba, Henneaux, and Troessaert (FHT) gave definitions
for supertranslation invariant Lorentz charges in the ADM Hamiltonian formalism
and showed that their definitions match with the Chen, Wang, Yau (CWY)
definitions of Lorentz charges at null infinity which are free from
``supertranslation ambiguities''. In this brief note, motivated by the analysis
of FHT, we write expressions for the supertranslation invariant Lorentz charges
in Beig-Schmidt variables at spacelike and timelike infinity. We present
calculations, building upon the work of Comp\`ere, Gralla, and Wei (CGW), to
show that our expressions for supertranslation invariant Lorentz charges match
the CWY definitions at null infinity.

Title: Neutrino Lorentz invariance violation from the CPT-even SME coefficients through a tensor interaction with cosmological scalar fields
Authors: Rubén Cordero, Luis A. Delgadillo, O. G. Miranda, C. A. Moura
Summary: Numerous non-standard interactions between neutrinos and scalar fields have
been suggested in the literature. In this work, we have outlined the case of
tensorial neutrino non-standard interactions with scalar fields, which can be
related to the effective CPT-even dimension-4 operators of the Standard Model
Extension (SME). Moreover, in this paper, we have mostly analyzed the projected
sensitivities to the CPT-even isotropic $c_{\alpha \beta}$ and $Z-$spatial
$c_{\alpha \beta}^{ZZ}$ SME coefficients, in the context of a long-baseline
experimental configuration. We study the particular case of DUNE and show its
sensitivity to this type of new physics. The current IceCube experiment and
upcoming neutrino experiments such as KM3NeT, IceCube-Gen2, and GRAND proposals
may clarify these classes of neutrino non-standard interactions.

Title: Shadow, ISCO, Quasinormal modes, Hawking spectrum, Weak Gravitational lensing, and parameter estimation of a Schwarzschild Black Hole Surrounded by a Dehnen Type Dark Matter Halo
Authors: Sohan Kumar Jha
Summary: We consider \s black hole (BH) embedded in a Dehnen-$(1,4,0)$ type dark
matter halo (DDM) with two additional parameters - core radius $r_s$ and core
density $\rho_s$ apart from mass $M$. We analyze the event horizon, photon
orbits, and ISCO around DDM BHs and emphasize the impact of DDM parameters on
them. Our study reveals the adverse effect of dark matter (DM) on the radii of
photon orbits, the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO), and the event
horizon. We find the expressions for specific energy and angular momentum for
massive particles in time-like geodesics around DDM BH and investigate their
dependence on DDM parameters. We display BH shadows for various values of core
density and radius that reveal smaller shadows cast by a \s BH surrounded by
DDM (SDDM) than a \s BH in vacuum (SV). We then move on to study quasinormal
modes (QNMs) with the help of the $6th$ order WKB method, the greybody factor
using the semi-analytic bounds method, and the Hawking spectrum for scalar and
electromagnetic perturbations. Core density and radius are found to have a
significant impact on QNMs. Since QNMs for scalar and electromagnetic
perturbations differ significantly, we can differentiate the two based on QNM
observation. The greybody factor and the power emitted as Hawking radiation are
adversely impacted by the presence of DM. We then study the weak gravitational
lensing using the Gauss-Bonnet theorem and obtain a deflection angle with
higher-order correction terms. Here, we see the deflection angle gets
attenuated due to DM. Finally, we use bounds on the deviation from \s,
$\delta$, reported by EHT for $M87^*$, Keck, and VLTI observatories for $Sgr
A^*$ to gauge the viability of our model. Our model is found to be concordant
with observations for finite parameter space. This leads to the possibility of
our galactic center being surrounded by DDM.

Title: Controlled closed timelike geodesics in a rotating Alcubierre spacetime
Authors: Achintya Sajeendran, Timothy C. Ralph
Summary: We present two modifications to the rotating Alcubierre metric [1], which was
shown to permit closed timelike curves (CTCs). We find that if the rotation
rate of the spacetime is made spatially dependent, in certain cases there exist
simple approximate timelike geodesics that are also CTCs, provided that the
velocity of the warp bubble varies slowly. The second modification is
essentially the original Alcubierre metric [ 2 ] with a periodic boundary,
resulting in a cylindrical spacetime which can also be related to the rotating
Alcubierre metric. Furthermore, this spacetime contains simple exact timelike
geodesics that are also CTCs. In both modifications, the CTC geodesics that we
have found allow for a simple model of a particle interacting with a CTC for a
finite proper time interval, entering and exiting in chronology-respecting
space. Given the simplicity of both of these exotic spacetimes, despite their
questionable physical realisability, we suggest that they may be useful in
studies of quantum fields near CTCs.
