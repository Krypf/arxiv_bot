Title: Kasner interiors from analytic hairy black holes
Authors: Daniel Areán, Hyun-Sik Jeong, Juan F. Pedraza, Le-Chen Qu
Summary: We conduct an exhaustive study of the interior geometry of a family of
asymptotically AdS$_{d+1}$ hairy black holes in an analytically controllable
setup. The black holes are exact solutions to an Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton
theory and include the well-known Gubser-Rocha model. After reviewing the
setup, we scrutinize the geometry beyond the horizon, finding that these
backgrounds can exhibit timelike or Kasner singularities. We generalize the no
inner-horizon theorem for hairy black holes to accommodate these findings. We
then consider observables sensitive to the geometry behind the horizon, such as
Complexity = Anything and the thermal $a$-function. In the Kasner case, we
propose a new variant of complexity that characterizes the late-time rate by
the Kasner exponents, extending previous work by J{\o}rstad, Myers and Ruan.
Additionally, we elucidate the power-law behavior of the thermal $a$-function
near the singularity, directly relating it to the Kasner exponents. Finally, we
introduce axion-like fields in the Gubser-Rocha model to study the impact of
translational symmetry breaking on the black hole interior. We show that Kasner
singularities occur for both explicit and spontaneous symmetry breaking, with
the Kasner exponents depending on the strength of broken translations only in
the latter case.

Title: IDEAL characterization of vacuum pp-waves
Authors: Igor Khavkine, David McNutt, Lode Wylleman
Summary: An IDEAL characterization of a particular spacetime metric, $g_0$, consists
of a set of tensorial equations $T[g] = 0$ arising from expressions constructed
from the metric, $g$, its curvature tensor and its covariant derivatives and
which are satisfied if and only if $g$ is locally isometric to the original
metric $g_0$. Earlier applications of the IDEAL classification of spacetimes
relied on the construction of particular scalar polynomial curvature invariants
as an important step in the procedure.
  In this paper we investigate the well-known class of vacuum pp-wave
spacetimes, where all scalar polynomial curvature invariants vanish, and
determine the applicability of an IDEAL classification for these spacetimes. We
consider a modification of the IDEAL approach which permits a corresponding
extension of the Stewart-Walker lemma. With this change, we are able to
construct invariants and IDEAL-ly classify all of the vacuum pp-wave solutions
which admit a two- or higher-dimensional isometry group, with the exception of
one case.

Title: Gravitational wave surrogate model for spinning, intermediate mass ratio binaries based on perturbation theory and numerical relativity
Authors: Katie Rink, Ritesh Bachhar, Tousif Islam, Nur E. M. Rifat, Kevin Gonzalez-Quesada, Scott E. Field, Gaurav Khanna, Scott A. Hughes, Vijay Varma
Summary: We present BHPTNRSur2dq1e3, a reduced order surrogate model of gravitational
waves emitted from binary black hole (BBH) systems in the comparable to large
mass ratio regime with aligned spin ($\chi_1$) on the heavier mass ($m_1$). We
trained this model on waveform data generated from point particle black hole
perturbation theory (ppBHPT) with mass ratios varying from $3 \leq q \leq 1000$
and spins from $-0.8 \leq \chi_1 \leq 0.8$. The waveforms are $13,500 \ m_1$
long and include all spin-weighted spherical harmonic modes up to $\ell = 4$
except the $(4,1)$ and $m = 0$ modes. We find that for binaries with $\chi_1
\lesssim -0.5$, retrograde quasi-normal modes are significantly excited,
thereby complicating the modeling process. To overcome this issue, we introduce
a domain decomposition approach to model the inspiral and merger-ringdown
portion of the signal separately. The resulting model can faithfully reproduce
ppBHPT waveforms with a median time-domain mismatch error of $8 \times
10^{-5}$. We then calibrate our model with numerical relativity (NR) data in
the comparable mass regime $(3 \leq q \leq 10)$. By comparing with spin-aligned
BBH NR simulations at $q = 15$, we find that the dominant quadrupolar
(subdominant) modes agree to better than $\approx 10^{-3} \ (\approx 10^{-2})$
when using a time-domain mismatch error, where the largest source of
calibration error comes from the transition-to-plunge and ringdown
approximations of perturbation theory. Mismatch errors are below $\approx
10^{-2}$ for systems with mass ratios between $6 \leq q \leq 15$ and typically
get smaller at larger mass ratio. Our two models - both the ppBHPT waveform
model and the NR-calibrated ppBHPT model - will be publicly available through
gwsurrogate and the Black Hole Perturbation Toolkit packages.

Title: Searching for String Bosenovas with Gravitational Wave Detectors
Authors: Dawid Brzeminski, Anson Hook, Junwu Huang, Clayton Ristow
Summary: We study the phenomenology of string bosenova explosions in vector
superradiance clouds around spinning black holes, focusing on the observable
consequences in gravitational wave detectors and accelerometers. During the
growth of the superradiance cloud, the dark gauge field might reach a critical
field strength, when a network of dark photon strings is produced via a
superheated phase transition. These dark photon strings will then absorb the
energy in the background fields and get ejected from the cloud, with total
energy as large as the rotational energy of the black hole. In this paper, we
study the subsequent evolution of this dense string network, and the resulting
observational consequences depending on the unknown string tension, or almost
equivalently, the ratio between the quartic and the gauge coupling in the
Abelian Higgs model. Strings with large tension will dissipate into
gravitational waves, detectable over a wide range of frequencies, from $\sim$
nHz near supermassive black holes, to $\gtrsim 10$ MHz around stellar mass
black holes. This is the first known source of high frequency gravitational
waves, unconstrained by cosmological observations. The strain of this
gravitational wave can be larger than $10^{-14}$ at low frequencies, lasting
for longer than typical duration of experiments. Small tension strings, with
total lengths in the network as large as $10^{40}$ km, can travel to the earth
with appreciable rate from any black hole in the Milky Way and interact with
earth based accelerometers. If the Standard Model particles are directly
charged under the dark photon, e.g. B-L, this interaction leads to an
acceleration of Standard Model particles that is independent of the coupling
constant. We work out the spectral density of this acceleration, and project
that modern accelerometers and equivalence principle tests can be sensitive to
the passing of these strings.

Title: Gravitational radiation reaction for compact binary systems at the fourth-and-a-half post-Newtonian order
Authors: Luc Blanchet, Guillaume Faye, David Trestini
Summary: We compute the gravitational radiation-reaction force on a compact binary
source at the fourth-and-a-half post-Newtonian (4.5PN) order of general
relativity, i.e., 2PN order beyond the leading 2.5PN radiation reaction. The
calculation is valid for general orbits in a general frame, but in a particular
coordinate system which is an extension of the Burke-Thorne coordinate system
at the lowest order. With the radiation-reaction acceleration, we derive (from
first principles) the flux-balance laws associated with the energy, the angular
and linear momenta, and the center-of-mass position, in a general frame and up
to 4.5PN order. Restricting our attention to the frame of the center of mass,
we point out that the equations of motion acquire a non-local-in-time
contribution at the 4.5PN order, made of the integrated flux of linear momentum
(responsible for the recoil of the source) together with the instantaneous flux
of center-of-mass position. The non-local contribution was overlooked in the
past literature, which assumed locality of the radiation-reaction force in the
center of mass frame at 4.5PN order. We discuss the consequences of this
non-local effect and obtain consistent non-local equations of motion and flux
balance laws at 4.5PN order in the center-of-mass frame.

Title: Conformal quantum mechanics of causal diamonds: Quantum instability and semiclassical approximation
Authors: H. E. Camblong, A. Chakraborty, P. Lopez-Duque, C. Ordóñez
Summary: Causal diamonds are known to have thermal behavior that can be probed by
finite-lifetime observers equipped with energy-scaled detectors. This
thermality can be attributed to the time evolution of observers within the
causal diamond, governed by one of the conformal quantum mechanics (CQM)
symmetry generators: the noncompact hyperbolic operator $S$. In this paper, we
show that the unbounded nature of $S$ endows it with a quantum instability,
which is a generalization of a similar property exhibited by the inverted
harmonic oscillator potential. Our analysis is semiclassical, including a
detailed phase-space study of the classical dynamics of $S$ and its dual
operator $R$, and a general semiclassical framework yielding basic instability
and thermality properties that play a crucial role in the quantum behavior of
the theory. For an observer with a finite lifetime $\mathcal{T}$, the detected
temperature
  $T_D = 2 \hbar/(\pi \mathcal{T})$ is associated with a Lyapunov exponent
$\lambda_L = \pi T_D/\hbar$, which is half the upper saturation bound of the
information scrambling rate.

Title: Large $D$ gravity and low $D$ string via $α^{\prime}$ corrections
Authors: Shuxuan Ying
Summary: In this paper, we generalize the correspondence between large $D$ gravity and
low $D$ string theory to the most general case, including its T-dual solutions.
It is well-known that the large $D$ limit of the Schwarzschild-Tangherlini
black hole in gravity becomes a two-dimensional near-horizon geometry.
Similarly, the large $D$ limit of its T-dual solution, obtained by the Buscher
rules, namely the string black hole with a naked singularity, reduces to a
two-dimensional near-singularity geometry. Both of these geometries are
described by the two-dimensional low-energy effective action of string theory
and are related to each other by scale-factor duality. Secondly, we demonstrate
that these near-horizon/singuglarity geometries, including complete
$\alpha^{\prime}$ corrections, can be described by the two-dimensional
Hohm-Zwiebach action. This approach allows for the derivation of
non-perturbative and non-singular solutions. Furthermore, the Hohm-Zwiebach
action provides a systematic way to investigate the $\alpha^{\prime}$-corrected
near-horizon/singularity geometries of different kinds of black holes, which
are difficult to achieve through the Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) model method.

Title: Conformal quantum mechanics of causal diamonds: Time evolution and thermality via path integral functionals
Authors: H. E. Camblong, A. Chakraborty, P. Lopez-Duque, C. Ordóñez
Summary: An observer with a finite lifetime $\mathcal{T}$ perceives the Minkowski
vacuum as a thermal state at temperature $T_D = 2 \hbar/(\pi \mathcal{T})$, as
a result of being constrained to a double-coned-shaped region known as a causal
diamond. In this paper, we explore the emergence of thermality in causal
diamonds due to the role played by the symmetries of conformal quantum
mechanics (CQM) as a (0+1)-dimensional conformal field theory, within the de
Alfaro-Fubini-Furlan model and generalizations. In this context, the hyperbolic
operator $S$ of the SO(2,1) symmetry of CQM is the generator of the time
evolution of a diamond observer, and its dynamical behavior leads to the
predicted thermal nature. Our approach is based on a comprehensive framework of
path-integral representations of the CQM generators in canonical and
microcanonical forms, supplemented by semiclassical arguments. The properties
of the operator $S$ are studied with emphasis on an operator duality with the
corresponding elliptic operator $R$, using a representation in terms of an
effective scale-invariant inverse square potential combined with inverted and
ordinary harmonic oscillator potentials.

Title: Weyl gauge invariant DBI action in conformal geometry
Authors: D. M. Ghilencea
Summary: We construct the analogue of the Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI) action in Weyl
conformal geometry in $d$ dimensions to obtain a Weyl gauge invariant theory.
For $d=4$, in a leading order expansion the DBI action becomes the general Weyl
quadratic gravity action associated to this geometry, that has the same gauge
symmetry; this is broken spontaneously and Einstein-Hilbert gravity is
recovered in the broken phase, with $\Lambda>0$. The series expansion of the
DBI action also contains additional non-polynomial terms that can be generated
at quantum level in Weyl quadratic gravity in $d=4$, by a regularisation that
respects this gauge symmetry. Such a regularisation is automatically provided
by the DBI action in $d$ dimensions. If the Weyl gauge boson of dilatations is
`pure gauge', the DBI action recovers in the leading order the conformal
gravity action plus a locally Weyl invariant dilaton action. All fields are of
geometric origin, with no added matter or compensating Weyl scalars, etc. The
calculation is done in a Weyl {\it gauge covariant} and {\it metric}
formulation of Weyl conformal geometry in $d$ dimensions.

Title: Probing Penrose-type singularities in sonic black holes
Authors: Satadal Datta, Uwe R. Fischer
Summary: Addressing the general physical question whether spacetime singularities
inside black holes exist, we investigate the problem in the context of an
analogue system, a flowing laboratory liquid, for which the governing equations
are at least in principle known to all relevant scales, and in all regions of
the effective spacetime. We suggest to probe the physical phenomena taking
place close to a Penrose-type singularity in the interior of a $2+1$D analogue
black hole arising from a polytropic, inviscid, irrotational, and axisymmetric
steady flow, and propose to this end an experimental setup in a Bose-Einstein
condensate. Our study provides concrete evidence, for a well understood
dynamical system, that the Einstein equations are not necessary for a
singularity to form, demonstrating that Penrose-type spacetime singularities
can potentially also exist in non-Einsteinian theories of gravity. Finally, we
demonstrate how the singularity is physically avoided in our proposed
laboratory setup, and that our analysis can be generalized to three-dimensional
flows ($3+1$D analogues).

Title: New black ring with all independent conserved charges in five-dimensional minimal supergravity
Authors: Ryotaku Suzuki, Shinya Tomizawa
Summary: We present a new exact solution for a general non-BPS black ring in the
bosonic sector of five-dimensional minimal supergravity. This obtained solution
carries four independent conserved charges: the mass, two angular momenta, an
electric charge, and an additional dipole charge related to other charges. By
employing the Ehlers-Harrison transformation, we derive this solution by
transforming a five-dimensional vacuum solution into a charged solution in the
theory. Previously, our work produced a vacuum doubly rotating black ring
solution possessing a Dirac-Misner string singularity by using the Ehlers
transformation. In this study, we use the singular black ring as the seed for
the Harrison transformation. The resultant solution exhibits regularity, free
from curvature singularities, conical singularities, orbifold singularities,
Dirac-Misner string singularities, and closed timelike curves both on and
outside the horizon. We show that within a specific parameter range, the black
ring presents two branches for the same mass, two angular momenta and electric
charge but these are distinguished by a dipole charge, which exhibits
discontinuous non-uniqueness. Furthermore, this newly obtained black ring
seamlessly connects to various physically significant solutions, such as the
Pomeransky-Sen'kov black ring, the extremal black ring, the supersymmetric
black ring, and the charged singly-spinning black ring.

Title: Prospects for Observing High-redshift Radio-loud Quasars in the SKA Era: Paving the Way for 21-cm Forest Observations
Authors: Qi Niu, Yichao Li, Yidong Xu, Hong Guo, Xin Zhang
Summary: The 21-cm forest is a sensitive probe for the early heating process and
small-scale structures during the epoch of reionization (EoR), to be realized
with the upcoming Square Kilometre Array (SKA). Its detection relies on the
availability of radio-bright background sources, among which the radio-loud
quasars are very promising, but their abundance during the EoR is still poorly
constrained due to limited observations. Here, we use a physics-driven model to
forecast future radio-loud quasar observations. We fit the parameters of the
model using observational data of high-redshift quasars. Assuming Eddington
accretion, the model yields an average lifetime of $t_{\rm q} \sim 10^{5.3}$yr
for quasars at $z\sim6$, consistent with recent results obtained from quasar
proximity zone pre-study. We show that if the radio-loud fraction of quasars
evolves with redshift, it will significantly reduce the abundance of observable
radio-loud quasars in the SKA era, making 21-cm forest studies challenging.
With a constant radio-loud fraction, our model suggests that a one-year sky
survey conducted with SKA-LOW has the capability to detect approximately 20
radio-loud quasars at $z\sim 9$, with sufficient sensitivity to resolve
individual 21-cm forest lines.

Title: What is the Curvature of 2D Euclidean Quantum Gravity?
Authors: R. Loll, T. Niestadt
Summary: We re-examine the nonperturbative curvature properties of two-dimensional
Euclidean quantum gravity, obtained as the scaling limit of a path integral
over dynamical triangulations of a two-sphere, which lies in the same
universality class as Liouville quantum gravity. The diffeomorphism-invariant
observable that allows us to compare the averaged curvature of highly
quantum-fluctuating geometries with that of classical spaces is the so-called
curvature profile. A Monte Carlo analysis on three geometric ensembles, which
are physically equivalent but differ by the inclusion of local degeneracies,
leads to new insights on the influence of finite-size effects. After
eliminating them, we find strong evidence that the curvature profile of 2D
Euclidean quantum gravity is best matched by that of a classical round
four-sphere, rather than the five-sphere found in previous work. Our analysis
suggests the existence of a well-defined quantum Ricci curvature in the scaling
limit.

Title: Deriving Weyl double copies with sources
Authors: Kymani Armstrong-Williams, Nathan Moynihan, Chris D. White
Summary: The Weyl double copy is a relationship between classical solutions in gauge
and gravity theories, and has previously been applied to vacuum solutions in
both General Relativity and its generalisations. There have also been
suggestions that the Weyl double copy should extend to solutions with
non-trivial sources. In this paper, we provide a systematic derivation of
sourced Weyl double copy formulae, using spinorial methods previously
established for ${\cal N}=0$ supergravity. As a cross-check, we rederive the
same formulae using a tensorial approach, which then allows us to extend our
arguments to sources containing arbitrary powers of the inverse radial
coordinate. We also generalise our results to include the Kerr-Newman black
hole, clarifying previous alternative double copy formulae presented in the
literature. Our results extend the validity of the Weyl double copy, and may be
useful for further astrophysical applications of this correspondence.

Title: Testing non-local gravity through Ultra-Diffuse Galaxies kinematics
Authors: Filippo Bouchè, Salvatore Capozziello, Ciro De Simone, Vincenzo Salzano
Summary: The emergence of the Ultra-Diffuse Galaxies in recent years has posed a
severe challenge to the galaxy formation models as well as the Extended
Theories of Gravity. The existence of both dark matter lacking and dark matter
dominated systems within the same family of astrophysical objects indeed
requires the gravity models to be versatile enough to describe very different
gravitational regimes. In this work, we study a non-local extension of the
theory of General Relativity that has drawn increasing attention in recent
years due to its capability to account for the late time cosmic acceleration
without introducing any dark energy fluid. We leverage the kinematic data of
three Ultra-Diffuse Galaxies: NGC 1052-DF2 and NGC 1052-DF4, which are dark
matter lacking, and Dragonfly 44, which exhibits a highly dominant dark matter
component. Our analysis shows that the non-local corrections to the Newtonian
potential do not affect the kinematic predictions, hence no spoiling effects
emerge when the Non-local Gravity model serves as a dark energy model. We
additionally provide the minimum value that the characteristic non-local radii
can reach at these mass scales.

Title: Neutrino cosmology after DESI: tightest mass upper limits, preference for the normal ordering, and tension with terrestrial observations
Authors: Jun-Qian Jiang, William Giarè, Stefano Gariazzo, Maria Giovanna Dainotti, Eleonora Di Valentino, Olga Mena, Davide Pedrotti, Simony Santos da Costa, Sunny Vagnozzi
Summary: The recent DESI Baryon Acoustic Oscillation measurements have led to tight
upper limits on the neutrino mass sum, potentially in tension with oscillation
constraints requiring $\sum m_{\nu} \gtrsim 0.06\,{\text{eV}}$. Under the
physically motivated assumption of positive $\sum m_{\nu}$, we study the extent
to which these limits are tightened by adding other available cosmological
probes, and robustly quantify the preference for the normal mass ordering over
the inverted one, as well as the tension between cosmological and terrestrial
data. Combining DESI data with Cosmic Microwave Background measurements and
several late-time background probes, the tightest $2\sigma$ limit we find
without including a local $H_0$ prior is $\sum m_{\nu}<0.05\,{\text{eV}}$. This
leads to a strong preference for the normal ordering, with Bayes factor
relative to the inverted one of $46.5$. Depending on the dataset combination
and tension metric adopted, we quantify the tension between cosmological and
terrestrial observations as ranging between $2.5\sigma$ and $5\sigma$. These
results are strenghtened when allowing for a time-varying dark energy component
with equation of state lying in the physically motivated non-phantom regime,
$w(z) \geq -1$, highlighting an interesting synergy between the nature of dark
energy and laboratory probes of the mass ordering. If these tensions persist
and cannot be attributed to systematics, either or both standard neutrino
(particle) physics or the underlying cosmological model will have to be
questioned.

Title: Signatures of Low Mass Black Hole-Neutron Star Mergers
Authors: Rahime Matur, Ian Hawke, Nils Andersson
Summary: The recent observation of the GW230529 event indicates that black
hole-neutron star binaries can contain low-mass black holes. Since lower mass
systems are more favourable for tidal disruption, such events are promising
candidates for multi-messenger observations. In this study, we employ five
finite-temperature, composition-dependent matter equations of state and present
results from ten 3D general relativistic hydrodynamic simulations for the mass
ratios $q = 2.6$ and $5$. Two of these simulations target the chirp mass and
effective spin parameter of the GW230529 event, while the remaining eight
contain slightly higher-mass black holes, including both spinning ($a_{BH} =
0.7$) and non-spinning ($a_{BH} = 0$) models. We discuss the impact of the
equation of state, spin, and mass ratio on black hole-neutron star mergers by
examining both gravitational-wave and ejected matter properties. For the
low-mass ratio model we do not see fast-moving ejecta for the softest equation
of state model, but the stiffer model produces on the order of $10^{-6}M_\odot$
of fast-moving ejecta, expected to contribute to an electromagnetic
counterpart. Notably, the high-mass ratio model produces nearly the same amount
of total dynamical ejecta, but yields $52$ times more fast-moving ejecta than
the low-mass ratio system. In addition, we observe that the black-hole spin
tends to decrease the amount of fast-moving ejecta while increasing
significantly the total ejected mass. Finally, we note that the disc mass tends
to increase as the neutron star compactness decreases.

Title: Irreducible decompositions of tensors via the Brauer algebra and applications to metric-affine gravity
Authors: Thomas Helpin
Summary: In the first part of this thesis, we make use of representation theory of
groups and algebras to perform an irreducible decomposition of tensors in the
context of metric-affine gravity. In particular, we consider the action of the
orthogonal group O(1, d$-1$) on the Riemann tensor associated with an affine
connection defined on a d-dimensional pseudo-Riemannian manifold. This
connection, with torsion and non-metricity, is the characteristic ingredient of
metric-affine theories of gravity.
  In the second part of this thesis, we construct the projection operators used
for the aforementioned decomposition. They are realized in terms of the
symmetric group algebra $\mathbb{C}\mathfrak{S}_n$ and of the Brauer algebra
B$_n$(d) which are related respectively to the action of GL(d,$\mathbb{C}$)
(and its real form GL(d,$\mathbb{R}$)) and to the action of O(d,$\mathbb{C}$)
(and its real form O(1 , d$-1$)) on tensors via the Schur-Weyl duality. First
of all, we give an alternative approach to the known formulas for the central
idempotents of $\mathbb{C}\mathfrak{S}_n$. These elements provide a unique
reducible decomposition, known as the isotypic decomposition. For our purposes,
this decomposition is remarkably handy to arrive at the sought after
irreducible decomposition with respect to GL(d,$\mathbb{R}$). Then, we
construct the elements in B$_n$(d) which realize the isotypic decomposition of
a tensor under the action of O(d,$\mathbb{C}$). This decomposition is
irreducible under O(d,$\mathbb{C}$) when applied to an irreducible
GL(d,$\mathbb{C}$) tensor of order $5$ or less. As a by product of the
construction, we give a solution to the problem of decomposing an arbitrary
tensor into its traceless part, doubly traceless part and so on. These results
led to the development of several Mathematica packages linked to the
\textit{xAct} bundle for tensor calculus in field theory.

Summary: Nonlinear simulations of neutron star mergers are complicated by the need to
represent turbulent dynamics. As we cannot (yet) perform simulations that
resolve accurately both the gravitational-wave scale and the smallest scales at
which magneto/hydrodynamic turbulence plays a role, we need to rely on
approximations. Addressing this problem in the context of large-eddy models, we
outline a coherent Lagrangian filtering framework that allows us to explore the
many issues that arise, linking conceptual problems to practical
implementations and the interpretation of the results. We develop understanding
crucial for quantifying unavoidable uncertainties in current and future
numerical relativity simulations and consider the implications for neutron-star
parameter estimation and constraints on the equation of state of matter under
extreme conditions.

Summary: Recently, we constructed the specific solution to the second-order
cosmological perturbation theory, around any

and a positive cosmological constant. In this paper, we use the Cosmicflows-4

this metric tensor. We obtain an approximation to the local matter distribution
and geometry. We numerically solve for null geodesics for randomly distributed
mock sources and compare this model with the Lemaitre-Hubble constant inferred
from the observations under the assumption of perfect isotropy and homogeneity.
We conclude on effects of realistic inhomogeneities on the luminosity distance
in the context of the Hubble tension and discuss limitations of our approach.

Title: Toward a test of Gaussianity of a gravitational wave background
Authors: Reginald Christian Bernardo, Stephen Appleby, Kin-Wang Ng
Summary: The degree of Gaussianity of a field offers insights into its cosmological
nature, and its statistical properties serve as indicators of its Gaussianity.
In this work, we examine the signatures of Gaussianity in a gravitational wave
background (GWB) by analyzing the cumulants of the one- and two-point functions
of the relevant observable, using pulsar timing array (PTA) simulations as a
proof-of-principle. This appeals to the ongoing debate about the source of the
spatially-correlated common-spectrum process observed in PTAs, which is likely
associated with a nanohertz stochastic GWB. We investigate the distribution of
the sample statistics of the one-point function in the presence of a Gaussian
GWB. Our results indicate that, within PTAs, one-point statistics are
impractical for constraining the Gaussianity of the nanohertz GWB due to
dominant pulsar noises. However, our analysis of two-point statistics shows
promise, suggesting that it may be possible to constrain the Gaussianity of the
nanohertz GWB using PTA data. We also emphasize that the Gaussian signatures
identified in the one- and two-point functions in this work are expected to be
applicable to any gravitational wave background.

Title: Relativistic gravity in the inhomogeneous Universe
Authors: Theodore Anton
Summary: Cosmology is built on a relativistic understanding of gravity, where the
geometry of the Universe is dynamically determined by matter and energy. In the
cosmological concordance model, gravity is described by General Relativity, and
it is assumed that on large scales the Universe is homogeneous and isotropic.
These fundamental principles should be tested. In this thesis, we explore the
implications of breaking them.
  In order to understand possible modifications to gravity on cosmological
scales, we extend the formalism of parameterised post-Newtonian cosmology, an
approach for building cosmological tests of gravity that are consistent with
tests on astrophysical scales. We demonstrate how this approach can be used to
construct theory-independent equations for the cosmic expansion and its
first-order perturbations. Then, we apply the framework to observations of the
anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background. We use these to place novel
cosmological constraints on the evolution of the post-Newtonian parameters.
  We investigate the consequences of inhomogeneity and isotropy by developing a
new approach to studying anisotropy in the Universe, wherein we consider how an
anisotropic cosmology might emerge on large scales as a result of averaging
over inhomogeneous structures, and demonstrate how the emergent model is
affected by backreaction. We perform a detailed study of light propagation in a
wide class of inhomogeneous and anisotropic spacetimes, exploring the
conditions under which the Hubble diagram can be accurately predicted by an
anisotropic model constructed using explicit averaging, even in the presence of
large inhomogeneities. We show that observables calculated in a suitable
averaged description closely reproduce the true Hubble diagram on large scales,
as long as the spacetime possesses a well-defined homogeneity scale.

Summary: Scalar fields which are favorite among the possible candidates for the dark
energy usually have degenerate minima at $\pm \phi_{min}$. In the presented
work, we discuss a two Higgs doublet model with the non-degenerate vacuum named
inert uplifted double well type two-Higgs doublet model (UDW-2HDM) for the dark
energy. It is shown that when the both Higgs doublets lie in their respective
true minima then one Higgs doublet can cause the current accelerated expansion
of the Universe.

Title: Differential Forms vs Geometric Algebra: The quest for the best geometric language
Authors: Pablo Bañón Pérez, Maarten DeKieviet
Summary: Differential forms is a highly geometric formalism for physics used from
field theories to General Relativity (GR) which has been a great upgrade over
vector calculus with the advantages of being coordinate-free and carrying a
high degree of geometrical content.
  In recent years, Geometric Algebra appeared claiming to be a unifying
language for physics and mathematics with a high level of geometrical content.
Its strength is based on the unification of the inner and outer product into a
single geometric operation, and its easy interpretation.
  Given their similarities, in this article we compare both formalisms
side-by-side to narrow the gap between them in literature. We present a direct
translation including differential identities, integration theorems and various
algebraic identities.
  As an illustrative example, we present the case of classical electrodynamics
in both formalism and finish with their description of GR.

Title: Schwarzschild black-hole immersed in uniform electric or magnetic backgrounds in Entangled Relativity
Authors: Olivier Minazzoli, Maxime Wavasseur
Summary: In this paper, we present the solution for a Schwarzschild black-hole
immersed in an electric or magnetic background field within the framework of
Entangled Relativity. Previous solutions in Entangled Relativity required
black-holes to be charged for the matter field to be defined everywhere. This
is because the theory precludes the existence of vacuum solutions, thereby
satisfying Einstein's definition of Mach's Principle. The current black-hole
solutions represent the first exact and neutral black-hole solutions of
Entangled Relativity discovered to date. The Schwarzschild black-hole of
General Relativity emerges as a limit of these solutions when the background
field approaches zero, whereas the Melvin solution of General Relativity does
not emerge as a limit when the black hole's size approaches zero. This finding
suggests that astrophysical black-holes in Entangled Relativity are
indistinguishable from those in General Relativity, given the generally weak
interstellar density of matter fields.

Title: Dissipative Quintessential Cosmic Inflation
Authors: Kourosh Nozari, Fateme Rajabi, Narges Rashidi
Summary: In this paper we construct a dissipative quintessential cosmic inflation. For
this purpose, we add a multiplicative dissipative term in the standard
quintessence field Lagrangian. We consider the specific form of dissipation as
the time integral including the Hubble parameter and an arbitrary function that
describes the dissipative properties of the quintessential scalar field.
Inflation parameters and observables are calculated under slow-roll
approximations and a detailed calculation of the cosmological perturbations is
performed in this setup. We consider different forms of potentials and
calculate the scalar spectral index and tensor-to-scalar ratio for a constant
as well as variable dissipation function. To check the reliability of this
model, a numerical analysis on the model parameters space is done in
confrontation with recent observational data. By comparing the results with
observational joint datasets at 68% and 95% confidence levels, we obtain some
constraints on the model parameters space, specially the dissipation factor
with e-folds numbers N = 55 and N = 60. As some specific results, we show that
the power-law potential with a constant dissipation factor and N = 60 is mildly
consistent with observational data in some restricted domains of the model
parameter space with very small and negative dissipation factor and a
negligible tensor-toscalar ratio. But this case with N = 55 is consistent with
observation considerably. For power-law potential and variable dissipation
factor as $Q = {\alpha}\phi^n$, the consistency with observation is also
considerable with a reliable tensor-to-scalar ratio. The quadratic and quartic
potentials with variable dissipation function as $Q = {\alpha}\phi^n$ are
consistent with Planck2018 TT, TE, EE+lowE+lensing data at the 68% and 95%
levels of confidence for some intervals of the parameter n.

Title: Aspects of Rotating Anisotropic Dark Energy Stars
Authors: O. P. Jyothilakshmi, Lakshmi J. Naik, V. Sreekanth
Summary: By employing modified Chaplygin fluid prescription for the dark energy, we
construct slowly rotating isotropic and anisotropic dark energy stars. The slow
rotation is incorporated via general relativistic Hartle-Thorne formalism;
whereas the anisotropy is introduced through Bowers-Liang prescription. We
consider both the monopole and quadrupole deformations and present a complete
analysis of rotating dark energy stars. By numerically solving the rotating
stellar structure equations in presence of anisotropy, we analyse and quantify
various properties of dark energy stars such as mass ($M$), radius, mass
deformation, angular momentum ($J$), moment of inertia, and quadrupole moment
($Q$), for three different equation of state parameters. We find that
anisotropic slow rotation results in significant deformation of stellar mass
and thereby affects other global properties studied. For the values of angular
frequencies considered, the effect of anisotropy on the stellar structure is
found to be more prominent than that due to rotation. The dimensionless
quadrupole moment $QM/J^2$ measuring deviation from a Kerr metric black hole
was obtained for anisotropic dark energy stars. We observe that dark energy
stars with higher anisotropic strength tend to approach the Kerr solution more
closely. We report that our results have considerable agreement with various
astrophysical observational measurements.

Title: Fractional Scalar Field Cosmology
Authors: S. M. M. Rasouli, S. Cheraghchi, P. V. Moniz
Summary: Considering the Friedmann--Lema\^{i}tre--Robertson--Walker (FLRW) metric and
the Einstein scalar field system as an underlying gravitational model to
construct fractional cosmological models has interesting implications in both
classical and quantum regimes. Regarding the former, we just review the most
fundamental approach to establishing an extended cosmological model. We
demonstrate that employing new methodologies allows us to obtain exact
solutions. Despite the corresponding standard models, we cannot use any
arbitrary scalar potentials; instead, it is determined from solving three
independent fractional field equations. This article concludes with an overview
of a fractional quantum/semi-classical model that provides an inflationary
scenario.

Title: Monte Carlo studies of quantum cosmology by the generalized Lefschetz thimble method
Authors: Chien-Yu Chou, Jun Nishimura
Summary: Quantum cosmology aims at elucidating the beginning of our Universe. Back in
early 80's, Vilenkin and Hartle-Hawking put forward the "tunneling from
nothing'' and "no boundary'' proposals. Recently there has been renewed
interest in this subject from the viewpoint of defining the oscillating path
integral for Lorentzian quantum gravity using the Picard-Lefschetz theory.
Aiming at going beyond the mini-superspace and saddle-point approximations, we
perform Monte Carlo calculations using the generalized Lefschetz thimble method
to overcome the sign problem. In particular, we confirm that either Vilenkin or
Hartle-Hawking saddle point becomes relevant if one uses the Robin boundary
condition depending on its parameter. We also clarify some fundamental issues
in quantum cosmology, such as an issue related to the integration domain of the
lapse function and an issue related to reading off the real geometry from the
complex geometry obtained at the saddle point.
