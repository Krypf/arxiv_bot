Title: Neutron stars as extreme gravity probes
Authors: Hector O. Silva
Summary: Neutron stars are powerful probes into the extremes of physics. In this
chapter, we will discuss how observations of neutron stars, either in isolation
or in binaries, can be leveraged to test general relativity and constrain
competing theories of gravity.

Title: Spatial curvature in coincident gauge $f(Q)$ cosmology
Authors: Erik Jensko
Summary: In this work we study the Friedmann-Lema\^{i}tre-Robertson-Walker cosmologies
with arbitrary spatial curvature for the symmetric teleparallel theories of
gravity, giving the first presentation of their coincident gauge form. Our
approach explicitly starts with the cosmological Killing vectors and constructs
the coincident gauge coordinates adapted to these Killing vectors. We then
obtain three distinct spatially flat branches and a single spatially curved
branch. Contrary to some previous claims, we show that all branches of
connection in the covariant approach can be studied in this gauge-fixed
formalism, which offers certain conceptual advantages. Interestingly, we find
that the flat and negative spatially curved solutions in $f(Q)$ gravity can be
seen as equivalent to the metric teleparallel $f(T)$ theories, demonstrating a
deeper connection between these theories. This is accomplished by studying the
connection equation of motion, which can be interpreted as a consistency
condition in the gauge-fixed approach. Finally, we discuss the role of
diffeomorphism invariance and local Lorentz invariance in these geometric
modifications of gravity.

Title: Heterotic Strings and Quantum Entanglement
Authors: Atish Dabholkar, Upamanyu Moitra
Summary: We construct $\mathbb{Z}_N$ orbifolds of the ten-dimensional heterotic string
theories appropriate for implementing the stringy replica method for the
calculation of quantum entanglement entropy. A novel feature for the heterotic
string is that the gauge symmetry must be broken by a Wilson line to ensure
modular invariance. We completely classify the patterns of symmetry breaking.
We show that the tachyonic contributions in all cases can be analytically
continued, with a finite answer in the domain $0<N \leq 1$, relevant for
calculating entanglement entropy across the Rindler horizon. We discuss the
physical implications of our results.

Title: Observational Signatures of Highly Magnified Gravitational Waves from Compact Binary Coalescence
Authors: Rico K. L. Lo, Luka Vujeva, Jose MarÃ­a Ezquiaga, Juno C. L. Chan
Summary: Gravitational lensing has empowered telescopes to discover astronomical
objects that are otherwise out of reach without being highly magnified by
foreground structures. While we expect gravitational waves (GWs) from compact
binary coalescences to also experience lensing, the phenomenology of highly
magnified GWs has not been fully exploited. In this letter, we fill this gap
and explore the observational signatures of these highly magnified GWs. We find
that these signatures are robust against modeling details and can be used as
smoking-gun evidence to confirm the detection of lensing of GWs without any
electromagnetic observation. Additionally, diffraction becomes important in
some cases, which limits the maximum possible magnification and gives waveform
signatures of lensing that can only be observed by GW detectors. Even with
current-generation observatories, we are already sensitive to these highly
magnified GWs and can use them to probe the high-redshift Universe beyond the
usual horizon.

Title: Generalized Uncertainty Principle theories and their classical interpretation
Authors: Matteo Bruno, Sebastiano Segreto, Giovanni Montani
Summary: In this work, we show that it is possible to define a classical system
associated with a Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) theory via the
implementation of a consistent symplectic structure. This provides a solid
framework for the classical Hamiltonian formulation of such theories and the
study of the dynamics of physical systems in the corresponding deformed phase
space. By further characterizing the functions that govern non-commutativity in
the configuration space using the algebra of angular momentum, we determine a
general form for the rotation generator in these theories and crucially, we
show that, under these conditions, unlike what has been previously found in the
literature at the quantum level, this requirement does not lead to the
superselection of GUP models at the classical level. Finally, we demonstrate
that a properly defined GUP theory can be correctly interpreted classically if
and only if the corresponding quantum commutators satisfy the Jacobi
identities.

Title: A better space of generalized connections
Authors: Juan Orendain, Jose A. Zapata
Summary: Given a base manifold $M$ and a Lie group $G$, we define $\widetilde{\cal
A}_M$ a space of generalized $G$-connections on $M$ with the following
properties:
  - The space of smooth connections ${\cal A}^\infty_M = \sqcup_\pi {\cal
A}^\infty_\pi$ is densely embedded in $\widetilde{\cal A}_M = \sqcup_\pi
\widetilde{\cal A}^\infty_\pi$; moreover, in contrast with the usual space of
generalized connections, the embedding preserves topological sectors.
  - It is a homogeneous covering space for the standard space of generalized
connections of loop quantization $\bar{\cal A}_M$.
  - It is a measurable space constructed as an inverse limit of of spaces of
connections with a cutoff, much like $\bar{\cal A}_M$. At each level of the
cutoff, a Haar measure, a BF measure and heat kernel measures can be defined.
  - The topological charge of generalized connections on closed manifolds $Q=
\int Tr(F)$ in 2d, $Q= \int Tr(F \wedge F)$ in 4d, etc, is defined.
  - On a subdivided manifold, it can be calculated in terms of the spaces of
generalized connections associated to its pieces. Thus, spaces of boundary
connections can be computed from spaces associated to faces.
  - The soul of our generalized connections is a notion of higher homotopy
parallel transport defined for smooth connections. We recover standard
generalized connections by forgetting its higher levels.
  - Higher levels of our higher gauge fields are often trivial. Then
$\widetilde{\cal A}_\Sigma = \bar{\cal A}_\Sigma$ for $\dim \Sigma = 3$ and
$G=SU(2)$, but $\widetilde{\cal A}_M \neq \bar{\cal A}_M$ for $\dim M = 4$ and
$G=SL(2, {\mathbb C})$ or $G=SU(2)$. Boundary data for loop quantum gravity is
consistent with our space of generalized connections, but a path integral for
quantum gravity with Lorentzian or euclidean signatures would be sensitive to
homotopy data.

Title: Anisotropic Dark Energy Stars within Vanishing Complexity Factor Formalism: Hydrostatic Equilibrium, Radial Oscillations, and Observational Implications
Authors: G. Panotopoulos, A. Rincon, I. Lopes
Summary: We investigate the structure and radial oscillations of anisotropic compact
stars composed of dark energy, using the vanishing complexity factor formalism
within general relativity. This novel approach establishes a direct link
between the energy density and anisotropic factor, providing a robust framework
for studying these exotic stellar objects. Employing an Extended Chaplygin Gas
equation of state, we numerically compute interior solutions for both isotropic
and anisotropic stars, revealing distinct differences in their properties.
Additionally, we examine the oscillation modes and frequencies of these stars,
highlighting the impact of anisotropy on their pulsational behavior. Our
results reveal distinct differences in the stellar properties, such as the
metric potentials, pressure, speed of sound, and relativistic adiabatic index,
between the two cases. Furthermore, we calculate the large frequency separation
for the fundamental and first excited modes, offering insights relevant for
future asteroseismology studies. Our findings shed light on the complex
interplay of gravity, matter, and anisotropy in compact stars, providing a new
perspective on dark energy's role in their structure and dynamics.
